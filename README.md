# Module 15: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Project Overview

This project is an effort to convince investors that a bikeshare program, like that in New York City, could thrive in Iowa's capital city, Des Moines. This project includes a bike trip analysis at the request of one of our potential investors. The project was almost entirely created in the Tableau visualization platform, with some data manipulation performed with the Python Pandas library.
